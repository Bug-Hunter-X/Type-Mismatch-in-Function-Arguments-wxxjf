# Type Mismatch in Function Arguments
This code demonstrates a type mismatch in function arguments in TypeScript.  The `add` function expects two numbers, but the code calls it with a string as the second argument, resulting in a type error.

The solution shows how to fix this by ensuring the arguments passed to the function match the expected types.
